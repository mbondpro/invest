# Invest
This is the home of a series of R scripts that can be used to analyze investment strategies and systems.

Backtest is the first such script. It allows one to test a buy-and-hold strategy against a default strategy, such as holding the S&P 500 index, as well as the most interesting (but usually unprofitable) strategy of using technical indicators to buy and sell. The calculation of the technical indicators is assisted mainly by the R port of the quantmod package.
